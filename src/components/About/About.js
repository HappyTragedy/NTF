          A successful marketing plan relies heavily on the pulling-power of
          advertising copy. Writing result-oriented ad copy is difficult, as it
          must appeal to, entice, and convince consumers to take action. There
          is no magic formula to write perfect ad copy; it is based on a number
          of factors, including ad placement, demographic, even the consumerâ€™s
          mood when they see your ad.
